The COUNTER program is a simple program that counts from 1 to 1000,
toggles the P1_0 bit and transmits the counter value out serial channel 0.

When you can successfully build and run this program, you have used the
entire toolset including:

* The uVision2 integrated development environment.
* The C51 compiler, linker and the µVision2 simulator/debugger.
* The Systronix C420 Board.

The program is available in two Targets:

  Simulator:                    uses the µVision2 simulator for testing
  Monitor for Systronix C420:   uses the Monitor with Systronix C420 board

To compile/assemble for the monitor, you must define MONITOR for conditional
assembly/compilation of stuff required (or excluded) for monitor debugging.
